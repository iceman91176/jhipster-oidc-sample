Sample Application for integration jhipster with OpenId Connect (http://openid.net/connect/)
Tested with WSO2 Identity server, but should work with other implementations also
OpenId Connect parameters are defined in application-dev/prod.yml file

Users that are authenticated successfully get USER role per default
